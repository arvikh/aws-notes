# IAM ( Identity and Access Management)

## What is aws IAM

IAM is the service which provides authentication and authorization to the users/services
which is very useful avoid abuse of usage of unwanted services in aws

## why we need IAM

IAM is required to stop abuse of services which given by authentication and authorization to the user

## IAM

1. Users
2. Policies
3. Groups
4. Roles

### User

The user , with the user creation it has passed the authentication phase so that it can enter in to the aws account . The user will have username and password

When we create the aws account we will have root user. We should not do anything with root user
So creating an additional user will be good.

We can create the user in IAM with all the info

### Policies

The policies are used to add permissions to user to which the user can have access
example: If we add policy of s3 read to user "A" the he can read only s3 no other applications can be accessible to him. This completed the authorization phase.

### Groups

Groups are something to which users and policies can be added for ease of usage.
Lets say we have dev ,qa , db admin and others in our project different teams authroized to have different policies so we will created a group for all 4 groups and we will add policies according to it. Then any new dev or qa etc can be added to respective group

### Roles

Roles are similar to users but they are temporary they can also have policies and credentials but mostly roles are used bu services to invoke or use another service
