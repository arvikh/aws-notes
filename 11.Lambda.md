# Lambda Function

Lambda function is a serverlesss service by aws

### Serverless

Serverless is something where will be no dedicated server for the application it will spin up the server when there is a requesta and autoscaling is done by the aws itself and deployment configuration is also done by aws. It is pay per request service , compared to ec2 it is more cheaper.

### Disadvantages

1. Serverless is stateless so doing websockets in serverless is difficult
2. Sometimes serverless can be slow becoz its cold start
3. Many of the companies provvide serverless azure functions, lambda, cloudfare workers, netlify functions, vercel functions

### Lambda in aws

1. We can go to Lambda and create a lambda function and here we need to add a trigger it can be anything alexa voice, s3 push or any event, we can attach api gateway and use it as rest api

2. We can use framework like serverless and give it access key and secret access id and make it easy diploymemt through

```
sls deploy
```
