# Route53

## What is Route 53

1. Provides DNS(Domain Name as service) as a service
2. When we deploy applications we will get IP address .
3. But in real world we use domain names
4. DNS is the thing which maps the IP address to the domain name
5. We need to do domain registration
6. Hosted Zoned have the DNS records
7. supports health checks-sends req to applications and perform health checks

## why Route 53

1. We cannot give IP address to user to access application
2. So we will buy the domain name
3. DNS maps the IP address and the domain name
4. Route 53 provides the DNS as a service

## Hosted Zones

This is the place where all the records will be stored
