# Cloud

## What is cloud

1. when we need to deploy application we used to have physical servers and deploy and maintain the data center but in that case. We need a team to look after all of these things and sometimes we may need more servers or some times we may waste the existing servers, In this case the virtualization concept is used to make VMs on top of the servers and that can be used for n no of application deployments but this need lot of infra and human resource.
2. The cloud is which makes the infra seamless with just on click it will spin up the server and we can deploy the application in the server. The companies like aws, azure and gcp make data centers in all parts of the world and manage the infra we just need to use them and create servers and use it. It is pay as u go service .

## Public vs Private Cloud

The Public cloud is something like aws, azure, gcp
The private cloud is something that is managed by an organization and it is used for itself

## why AWS

AWS is the fist comer inthis cloud race. It has the advantage of the user needs and it has over 200 services to serve the user
