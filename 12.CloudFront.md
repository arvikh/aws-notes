# Cloud Front

The cloud front service is a CDN ( content delivery network)

### Problem

when we have data(video/image /any data) in s3 storage and the user access it from the s3 lets say the data is in north verginia and user is in india there will latency to for the user to fetch the data . this is the problem,

### Solution

The CDN is something which is mapped through the bucket and edges the data i.e., it makes the cache of data in every specified /possible location and there by we can restrict the user acces directly to s3 bucket

#### How

Go to cloud front create distribution
select s3 bucket and give oai access to s3 bucket for this particular dirstruction and give other setttings it will create a cdn url with that we can access the data from s3 without s3 direct access
