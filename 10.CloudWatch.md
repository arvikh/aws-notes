# Cloud Watch

Watching the activities on cloud
Monitoring, alerting , reporting and logging, metrics
metrics- undersatnd about utilization of resources
custom metrics
cost optimization
scaling

1. Any activity in the aws will be logged by cloud watch
2. The activities will be logged after 5 mins in cloud watch as default time we can change it in ther service we are using
3. WE can create alarm for usage or any metric with SNS by creating the topic in SNC and adding the condition to metrics

## Metrics

In Amazon CloudWatch, metrics are fundamental concepts that you work with. A metric is the fundamental concept in CloudWatch and represents a time-ordered set of data points that are published to CloudWatch. Think of a metric as a variable to monitor, and the data points as representing the values of that variable over time. Metrics are uniquely defined by a name, a namespace, and zero or more dimensions. Every data point must have a timestamp. You can retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time-series data.

## Logs

AWS CloudWatch Logs service allows you to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS CloudTrail, and other sources. It centralizes the logs from all your systems, applications, and AWS services that you use, into a single, highly scalable service. You can then easily view them, search through them, set alarms, and correlate them to other operational data. It also integrates with AWS Lambda, providing the ability to respond quickly to critical operational events.

## Events

AWS CloudWatch Events is a service that provides a streamlined, systematic method to respond to system-wide changes in your AWS environment. This could range from a simple state change, like an EC2 instance being stopped or started, to a more complex series of conditions. You can set an Event Pattern to monitor AWS resources for specific changes or you can schedule cron jobs. The action resulting from the event pattern can be a Lambda function, SNS notification, or auto-scaling policy amongst other options. Essentially, AWS CloudWatch Events helps you automate your AWS services and respond automatically to system events.
